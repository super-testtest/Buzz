An advanced heat-reflective coating and innovative cooling system keeps heat where it should be.(/P)(B)Designed to Match (/B)(P)Available in black reflective glass and stainless steel finish, this durable oven matches the rest of Fisher & Paykel's coordinated kitchen family.(/P)(BR) Bake (P)The Bake function is for the traditional method of baking. Heat is radiated from the top and bottom elements of the oven with natural thermal convection currents distributing the heat. Moisture is retained within the cavity to provide light, moist results. It is best to bake on only one shelf at a time using this function to ensure the best result.(/P)(BR) Classic Bake (P)Classic Bake is a traditional baking function suitable for recipes developed in older ovens. Heat is generated only from the bottom, allowing for gentle cooking of delicate recipes and for those that require slow cooking. There is no direct heating to the top of the food so it's perfect for items that require minimal surface browning.(/P)(BR) Fan Bake (P)The Fan Bake function allows heat to be generated by elements at the top and bottom with the fan creating airflow throughout the oven. This increased airflow speeds up cooking and as a result, oven temperatures can be lowered by 20(degree)C for most recipes. Ideal for baked items that cook in less than one hour such as biscuits, muffins and cakes.(/P)(BR) True Aero(TM) (P)The True Aero function is great for multi-shelf cooking. Heat energy is generated at the rear of the cavity by a powerful element surrounding the fan and is distributed evenly throughout the space from behind the fan shroud. Salting the potatoes before you bake them draws out moisture from the potatoes, allowing the oven to give them an oven baked crispness. Take care when adding the potatoes into the hot dish as the hot oil can spit up and the hot shock is also important for super crispy chips.(/P)(BR) Aero(TM) Broil (P)The Aero Broil has the addition of the fan to circulate hot air throughout the oven. Intense heat and radiation provide an excellent environment for cooking large cuts of meats moist inside and crisp on the outside. A thermometer is a great tool for checking the internal temperature. Always insert it into the thickest part of the meat. Alternatively check for doneness by cutting into the thickest part and checking the juices run clear.(/P)(BR) Broil (P)The Broil function delivers intense heat from the inner region of the top element for when you need to quickly grill one or two portions. Perfect for cooking crispy chicken breast, steak and fish. The intensity of the Broil function can be finely controlled. For quick surface browning, HI is ideal. Here, level 7 ensures the tomatoes are cooked right through just as the spice mixture becomes perfectly caramelised.(/P)(BR) Aero(TM) Pastry (P)The Aero Pastry function is similar to Classic Bake, with the addition of the fan to circulate hot air around the cavity. It is good for food items that need more intense heat from the bottom but still require some heat on the top, such as pies and tarts.(/P)(BR) Roast (P)Roast is a specialised function that combines the power of Grill with the long, slow heating ability of Bake. Your food receives 20 minutes of grill power, with the remaining cooking time automatically reverting to Bake at the desired temperature. This function provides food with a crisp, flavoursome exterior and a succulent interior. The Auto-Roast function is fantastic for big cuts of meat and is versatile enough to be used for quick-roasting of thinner cuts or jointed meat and poultry.(/P)(BR) Aero(TM) Bake (P)Aero Bake is ideal for slow-roasting meat. Excess moisture is eliminated from the cavity, which promotes the slow development of delicious savoury flavours, while the heat from the upper and lower elements gently cooks the meat to give a succulent and tender result. Salsa verde is a refreshing and zesty alternative to a traditional gravy.(/P)(BR) Warm (P)Warm is a function similar to Bake, but limited to very gentle temperatures. This is not intended as a cooking function but is designed to keep food warm and limit the progression of cooking. Using the oven's specialised LO Warm setting we have taken the guesswork out of proving dough. The oven retains moisture and the LO temperature has to be specifically configured to optimise rising.(/P)",FISHER & PAYKEL,"30"" 11 Function Double Self-clean Built-in Oven",4999,"30"" 11 Function Double Self-clean Built-in Oven",1,2,4,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,88,88,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRTBCUACKDNV.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRTBCUACKDNV.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRTBCUACKDNV.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRTBCUACKDNV.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRTBCUACKDNV.PNG,

An advanced heat-reflective coating and innovative cooling system keeps heat where it should be.(/P)(B)Designed to Match (/B)(P)Finished in black reflective glass and stainless steel, these durable ovens match the rest of Fisher & Paykel's coordinated kitchen family.(/P)(BR) Bake (P)The Bake function is for the traditional method of baking. Heat is radiated from the top and bottom elements of the oven with natural thermal convection currents distributing the heat. Moisture is retained within the cavity to provide light, moist results. It is best to bake on only one shelf at a time using this function to ensure the best result.(/P)(BR) Classic Bake (P)Classic Bake is a traditional baking function suitable for recipes developed in older ovens. Heat is generated only from the bottom, allowing for gentle cooking of delicate recipes and for those that require slow cooking. There is no direct heating to the top of the food so it's perfect for items that require minimal surface browning.(/P)(BR) Fan Bake (P)The Fan Bake function allows heat to be generated by elements at the top and bottom with the fan creating airflow throughout the oven. This increased airflow speeds up cooking and as a result, oven temperatures can be lowered by 20(degree)C for most recipes. Ideal for baked items that cook in less than one hour such as biscuits, muffins and cakes.(/P)(BR) True Aero(TM) (P)The True Aero function is great for multi-shelf cooking. Heat energy is generated at the rear of the cavity by a powerful element surrounding the fan and is distributed evenly throughout the space from behind the fan shroud. Salting the potatoes before you bake them draws out moisture from the potatoes, allowing the oven to give them an oven baked crispness. Take care when adding the potatoes into the hot dish as the hot oil can spit up and the hot shock is also important for super crispy chips.(/P)(BR) Aero(TM) Broil (P)The Aero Broil has the addition of the fan to circulate hot air throughout the oven. Intense heat and radiation provide an excellent environment for cooking large cuts of meats moist inside and crisp on the outside. A thermometer is a great tool for checking the internal temperature. Always insert it into the thickest part of the meat. Alternatively check for doneness by cutting into the thickest part and checking the juices run clear.(/P)(BR) Broil (P)The Broil function delivers intense heat from the inner region of the top element for when you need to quickly grill one or two portions. Perfect for cooking crispy chicken breast, steak and fish. The intensity of the Broil function can be finely controlled. For quick surface browning, HI is ideal. Here, level 7 ensures the tomatoes are cooked right through just as the spice mixture becomes perfectly caramelised.(/P)(BR) Aero(TM) Pastry (P)The Aero Pastry function is similar to Classic Bake, with the addition of the fan to circulate hot air around the cavity. It is good for food items that need more intense heat from the bottom but still require some heat on the top, such as pies and tarts.(/P)(BR) Roast (P)Roast is a specialised function that combines the power of Grill with the long, slow heating ability of Bake. Your food receives 20 minutes of grill power, with the remaining cooking time automatically reverting to Bake at the desired temperature. This function provides food with a crisp, flavoursome exterior and a succulent interior. The Auto-Roast function is fantastic for big cuts of meat and is versatile enough to be used for quick-roasting of thinner cuts or jointed meat and poultry.(/P)(BR) Aero(TM) Bake (P)Aero Bake is ideal for slow-roasting meat. Excess moisture is eliminated from the cavity, which promotes the slow development of delicious savoury flavours, while the heat from the upper and lower elements gently cooks the meat to give a succulent and tender result. Salsa verde is a refreshing and zesty alternative to a traditional gravy.(/P) Aero Bake is ideal for slow-roasting meat. Excess moisture is eliminated from the cavity, which promotes the slow development of delicious savoury flavours, while the heat from the upper and lower elements gently cooks the meat to give a succulent and tender result. Salsa verde is a refreshing and zesty alternative to a traditional gravy. (BR) Warm (P)Warm is a function similar to Bake, but limited to very gentle temperatures. This is not intended as a cooking function but is designed to keep food warm and limit the progression of cooking. Using the oven's specialised LO Warm setting we have taken the guesswork out of proving dough. The oven retains moisture and the LO temperature has to be specifically configured to optimise rising.(/P)",FISHER & PAYKEL,"30"" 11 Function Self-clean Built-in Oven",2999,"30"" 11 Function Self-clean Built-in Oven",1,2,4,,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,88,88,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRQIJPOSEHNJ.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRQIJPOSEHNJ.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRQIJPOSEHNJ.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRQIJPOSEHNJ.PNG,http://www.specsserver.com/CACHE/FRQIJPOSEHNJ.PNG,
